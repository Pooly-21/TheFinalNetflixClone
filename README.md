The button from sign was done seperately, figured out last minute how to make it actually work. so i made an icon on the home page into the sign in.
{
Also has to do with the sign in,
which was supposed to redirect into the home page.
}

I had two repos and fusion summoned it, hence why the one upload to github.

I could not figure out the video popup (play and pause) and the watchlist broke so i left it out.
